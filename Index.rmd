## Introduction + Summary Information

Per the World Prison Brief, the United States currently incarcerates 629 people in prison per 100,000 citizens. This is the highest incarceration rate in the world. 

Much of this incarceration goes on at the county level in the US. Using data from the Vera Institute of Justice, I am analyzing the racial disparities of prison populations, specifically among white and black prison population rates per 100,000.
